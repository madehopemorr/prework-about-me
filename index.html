      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hello! My name is Maddy. I am 23 and new to coding with a little experience in HTML and CSS. I have a Bachelors in Film & Digital Media and am currently a waitress in the food industry. I decided to join UC Davis's coding bootcamp to further my education and increase my employment options. I may even go back to school again to study plant science and organic chemistry. I love science and learning and am excited for the journey ahead. </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Henderson, TX</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I love spending time in nature and enjoy gardening, hiking, and camping. I also like roller skating and think it would be cool to eventually join a roller derby team!  </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I would love to work from home as a programmer or data analyst. Someday I plan to have my own Homestead. Working from home would give me the freedom to spend time outside taking care of the land, working on projects, and conducting my own research.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Sacramento, CA</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I am new to coding, but can see myself thriving in this profession. I believe I have the right skillset and the demand for web and software developers is very high, pays well, and in a lot of cases allows you to work remotely, which is aweseome. I am excited to continue learning the many different coding languages and plan to rise to the challenges ahead.</p>
